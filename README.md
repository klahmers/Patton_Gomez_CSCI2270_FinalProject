# Patton_Gomez_CSCI2270_FinalProject

Project Summary: 
  We created a program where we can look for books in an online bookstore. 
  We are using two different kinds of data structures â€” Binary Seach Trees and Linked Lists to model 
  an online book store. We used the BST to create our collection of "book" nodes that the user will 
  be picking from. The linked list will be used to create a "shopping cart" where the books that the 
  user chooses from the store will be stored until check-out time. Users can search our bookstore 
  for the book titles they desire and will be able to add to their "shopping cart" if they want to 
  buy the book. At the end of the purchase once they choose to check-out we will provide them with 
  their total and a summary of their purchases. 

How to Run: 
The user will need four files to run our code:
- main.cpp
- Books.cpp
- Books.h
- bookList.txt


  The user will be presented with a main menu with 6 different options to choose from. 
  
      1. Find a book
      
      2. View our inventory
      
      3. Add a book to cart
      
      4. Remove a book from cart
      
      5. View cart
      
      6. Add a book rating
      
      7. Checkout
      
      8. Quit
    
    For example: 
     
      - Option #1 is used if they are looking for a particular book. The user can 
        select option #1 and they can input a title. If the book is 
        in stock the system will pull up all of its information and ask the 
        user if they wish to buy it. If the user decides to buy it, it will be added to the linked list and 
        appear in the "View Cart" option. If the book is not found it will display this message "Book not found". 
      - Option #2 is used if the user wants to look at the selection of books 
        that we have in our lovely store. When the user selects #2 from our menu, 
        a list of our books will print out with information about them.
      - Option #3 will offer the option to search for a book and if it is found it will be added to your cart. 
      - Option #4 allows you to remove a book from your cart in case you decided 
        you did not want it anymore. This will remove the book from your cart and it will
        update the book in our store's inventory. 
      - Option #5 will show the user their current cart and print out basic information about
        the books that are in your shopping cart.
      - Option #6 will allow the user to rate books from 1-5 
      - Option #7 will provide the buyer with a summary of their cart and it will provide
        a total, offer shipping options and a thank the user for shopping with us.
